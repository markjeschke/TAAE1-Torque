# TAAE1 Torque

This Objective-C Xcode project was created to demonstrate how to pause and restart an audio file with a slow-down and speed-up torque effect, similar to how a record player would affect its playback via a needle. In addition to using the varispeed effect filter, I also provided volume and stereo panning control via UISliders. Michael Tyson's [The Amazing Audio Engine](http://theamazingaudioengine.com/) (version 1.5.6) was used for this example, and was installed via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

The initial question for how to achieve this torque audio effect was posted on The Amazing Audio Engine forum here:

## Installation

1. `cd` to change your current directory to the location on your computer where you'd like to clone or install this repo. 
2. Download the zip file for enter `git clone git@github.com:markjeschke/TAAE1-Torque.git` into Terminal.
3. Navigate to and open the `TAAE1-Torque-master` directory.
4. Since this project utilizes CocoaPods, click on the **`TAAE1-Torque.xcworkspace`** to open the projectâ€“not the `TAAE1-Torque.xcodeproj` to run and build the app.
5. Since the Pods directory was included into this repo, you may want to update it in the Terminal by entering `pod update` in this project's directory.
