# TAAE1 Torque

This Objective-C Xcode project was created to demonstrate how to pause and restart an audio file with a slow-down and speed-up torque effect, similar to how a record player would affect its playback via a needle. In addition to using the varispeed effect filter, also provided volume and stereo panning control via UISliders. Michael Tyson's The Amazing Audio Engine (version 1.5.6) was used for this example, and was installed via CocoaPods.

The initial question for how to achieve this torque audio effect was posted on The Amazing Audio Engine forum here:
